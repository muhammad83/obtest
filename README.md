# OBtests

these tests have been written in bash.

## Note about import

`#!/usr/bin/env bash`

The above can be a potential security problem but as these are tests and this way gives more flexibilty, this has been used. 

## Running the tests

these tests assume you have jq installed. if its missing please install with the following command on a mac.

`brew install jq`
